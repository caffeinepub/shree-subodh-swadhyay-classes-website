## Summary
**Goal:** Improve mobile header clarity by removing the tagline from the header and optimizing the institute name layout/typography while keeping the rest of the site unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the tagline text “Empowering Dreams, Inspiring Success” from the header across all pages and breakpoints; keep the tagline only in the Home page hero section.
- Update header institute-name styling and responsive layout:
  - Desktop (lg+): keep logo + institute name aligned horizontally.
  - Mobile: ensure the institute name wraps cleanly to a maximum of 2 lines with no truncation/ellipsis and clear readability.
  - Apply bold, professional typography with high contrast: Brand Blue (#010080) text on a white (#FEFEFE) header background.
  - Preserve existing header structure (logo left, hamburger right) with adequate spacing for touch usability.

**User-visible outcome:** The header shows only “Shree Subodh Swadhyay Classes” next to the logo with improved readability on mobile (no tagline in the header), while the Home hero section still displays the tagline.
