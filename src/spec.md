# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the header brand area so the company name stays on one line next to the logo and uses the brand blue color.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the header layout/styling so the company name does not wrap into two lines and remains horizontally aligned to the right of the logo across common mobile and desktop widths.
- Change only the header company name text color to #010080 (brand blue), without impacting other site text colors.

**User-visible outcome:** In the sticky header, the company name appears as a single line beside the logo and displays in blue (#010080) without overlapping the navigation or mobile menu button.
