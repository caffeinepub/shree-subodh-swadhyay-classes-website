  "summary": "Header tagline appears removed and header now shows only the institute name in brand blue on a white background with logo-left/menu-right structure preserved. However, the diff does not clearly guarantee the mobile institute name will wrap to a maximum of 2 lines at all mobile widths.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Mobile: the institute name wraps cleanly to at most 2 lines (no truncation/ellipsis) while remaining clearly readable.",
      "reason": "The updated header name uses a fixed max width (max-w-[180px]) and responsive text sizing, but there is no explicit 2-line cap (e.g., line-clamp-2) or other constraint shown to ensure it cannot wrap to 3+ lines on very narrow screens. Also, the diff snippet does not show any explicit no-truncation/ellipsis handling beyond the absence of a 'truncate' class.",
