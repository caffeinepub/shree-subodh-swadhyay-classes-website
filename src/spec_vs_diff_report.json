  "summary": "The diff shows partial edits to `HomePage.tsx` (hero section text/CTAs) plus updates to `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json`, but the provided truncated code does not include any visible hero `<img>` element, its static `/assets/generated/...` path, or the CSS/container changes needed to ensure the full image is visible without cropping across breakpoints.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the Home page hero image rendering so the full hero photo is visible (not cropped or cut off) across common breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop). Update the hero image container/CSS so the image scales responsively and preserves the full photo (e.g., use a constrained aspect ratio and an object-fit strategy that does not crop).",
      "reason": "In the truncated `HomePage.tsx` diff, the hero section shows headings and buttons but no evidence of an image element or the container/CSS changes (e.g., aspect-ratio wrapper + `object-contain`) needed to guarantee the full photo is visible without cropping.",

      "requirement": "Verify the deployed/static asset path for the hero image is correct and that the file exists in the frontend static assets. If the hero image fails to load, update the code to point to the correct generated asset filename/path and ensure the hero image displays.",
      "reason": "No evidence is shown of the hero `<img>` referencing a static asset path under `/assets/generated/` (or any hero image path at all) within the truncated `HomePage.tsx` diff.",
