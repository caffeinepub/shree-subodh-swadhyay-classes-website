  "summary": "Header company name was updated in Layout to prevent wrapping (using `whitespace-nowrap`) and styled with a `text-brand-blue` class, but the diff does not provide clear evidence that the resulting color is exactly hex `#010080`. Several unrelated/global changes (brand palette utilities/variables and project metadata/docs) were also introduced beyond the two header-focused requirements.",

      "requirement": "Change the header company name text color from the current purple to the brand blue #010080.",
      "reason": "The header text now uses `text-brand-blue`, but `text-brand-blue` is defined via `oklch(var(--brand-blue))` and the diff sets `--brand-blue` to `0.20 0.15 265`, which is not shown to equal hex `#010080`. There is no direct hex assignment or demonstrated mapping guaranteeing the exact requested hex value.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to prevent header name wrapping and set the header company name color to `#010080`, and explicitly discourages reworking global Tailwind/theme colors beyond what is required. The diff adds broader global styling infrastructure not explicitly requested.",
